# Cataract Identification with Deep Learning

As my final project for my Deep Learning Lab course, I compared the performances of baseline CNN, ResNet-50, Inception, and VGGNet models for cataract classification. Models were implemented using TensorFlow in python for Kaggle's "Ocular Disease Recognition" dataset. 

Uploaded with the ipynb file above are the literature review, exploratory analysis, and conclusion documents.
